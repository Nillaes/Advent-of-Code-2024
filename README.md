# Hi! 
This repo contains all the scripts I have developed for the Advent of Code chellenges 2024. For this year's challenge I decided to challenge myself by using C/C++ as much as possible. In addtition to this I wanted to also pay attention to execution speed of my code.

At some point I expect the challenges to become too hard for me to do in C++ at that point I will switch to Python where I am much more experienced.

# Other Info
If you want to run these scripts yourself you will have to compile them. Make sure you have a compiler that can do this for you. If you want to import these in VS you can but you might go through some headaches to be able to compile them individually if you want them all in one solution.

I suggest you do as I do and directly call the compiler and tell it to compile the file. I use g++ you can use any other.
